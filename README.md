## What are Blinks?

Blinks (Blockchain Links) is an innovative gadget launched by the Solana blockchain, which can be shared on different social platforms through links, such as Twitter and Telegram. Through the gadgets generated by Blinks, users can perform different on-chain operations in a simple and clear interface, making the entire complicated process smoother and easier. For users, compared to the traditional method where users need to enter different websites before operating, using Blinks can immediately complete the entire blockchain transaction process on the social platform, greatly reducing the threshold for blockchain operations.
